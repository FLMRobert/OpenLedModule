# OpenLedModule
OpenLedModule - an Open Hardware LED module project

## Background

The goal of the OpenLedModule project is to provide Open Hardware LED modules for everyone.

With OpenLedModule, you can easily build your own lighting fixture:

1. **Choose a basic LED lamp model** that fits to your needs

   Example: choose the battery powered __HandLamp__

2. **Check which LED Module is required** for your lamp model

   Example: for the HandLamp, __Module 1__ is required

3. **Order the required number of LED Modules** from a PCB (circuit board) manufacturer of your choice 

   Example: order __three Module 1__ PCBs

4. **Order LEDs and resistors** that are required for the LED module

   Example: for Module 1, you need to order __six OSRAM Duris E5 LEDs__ and __six 14 Ohm resistors__   

5. **Solder your LED modules**  

   If you don't have reflow soldering equipment: go to a makerspace of your choice and solder it there.
   
   Most makerspaces own a temperature-controlle "pizza oven" for reflow soldering.
   
   With this oven, you can finalize your OpenLedModules.

6. **Assemble your LED lamp**

   Get all the material that is listed for the lamp module of your choice.
   
   Example: for the HandLamp you need an aluminium profile, a number of screws and a 3D printed hand grip.
   
   Feel free to change the lamp design by creating a fork of the lamp models that are presented here.

## Motivation

You can buy cheap LED lamps in every hardware store, but many of the lamps you get there are just cheap crap.

Commercial LED lamps tend to break down after a short time and in many cases you have to throw away the whole lamp
just because only one little part of it is broken.

The solution for this problem is: **simply build your own LED lamp!**
If a part of your self made lamp breaks down: just fix that part.

* If one LED breaks: fix the LED. 
* If the whole LED module breaks: replace it.
* If a circuit path breaks: fix it.
* If the power supply breaks: replace it.

It's easy - believe me. 
If your are not able to fix it on your own: ask a friend or go to the hackerspace around the corner.

That's what the OpenLedModule project is about: we provide basic LED lamp designs that work,
while making sure that these LED lamps can also be easily maintained.
